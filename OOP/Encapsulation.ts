            //  Encapsulation

//   Encapsulation is built on the idea of hiding data. This is where we restrict access to specific properties or methods.

// In our example, the property _name is private. This means we canâ€™t access this property from outside the class. To get access to this private property, we use the so-called getter and setter methods.
