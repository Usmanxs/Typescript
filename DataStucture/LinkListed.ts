/*A linked list is a data structure that holds objects arranged in a linear order, this order is determined by a pointer in each node.
Unlike an array, a linked list doesn't provide constant-time access to a particular index, you have to iterate through the list to find an element, on the other hand, is possible to add and remove items from the beginning of the list in a constant time.
Linked lists can be used to implement other data structures, such as stacks, queues, and graphs.

There are some types of linked lists:

Singly linked list - Each node has only a pointer to the next node.
Doubly linked list - Each node has pointers to both the previous and next node.
Circular linked list - The last node points to the first element. */
  
 // single link list
