// A queue uses FIFO (first-in-first-out) ordering, that is, items are removed from the queue in the same order that they are added, like a line.
// Queues can be used whenever is necessary to process things in that order (FIFO), like requests to a single shared resource, CPU scheduling, also helps in algorithms of other data structures, such as breadth-first search in graphs.
